# ftrace

Ftrace list all of the different inputs and outputs of a program’s function.
It list the following:
• system calls,
• a program’s internal function calls with their name and address,
• signals received from other programs,
• function calls contained in the shared libraries (.so).

Unfortunaly, we were not able to perform enough on this project, but I'm personally glad enough of the result
for its structuration.
It's not missing much to be able to perform the whole project.
